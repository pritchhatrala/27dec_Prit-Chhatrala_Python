# How does the Python code structure work?


'''Python code structure is organized for readability and simplicity, relying on indentation to define blocks such as functions, loops, and classes. Programs often start with module imports, followed by function and class definitions, and may include a main block (if __name__ == "__main__":) for script execution. Variables and control statements like if, for, and while guide program flow. Comments (#) and docstrings (""") document the code. Projects are typically structured into modules and directories for organization, and scripts are executed line by line using the Python interpreter. Following PEP 8 guidelines ensures clean, consistent, and maintainable code.'''
