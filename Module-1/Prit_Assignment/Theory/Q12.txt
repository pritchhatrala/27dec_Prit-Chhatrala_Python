12. Nested if-else conditions. 

A nested if-else statement occurs when an if or else condition is placed inside another if or else. This allows for more complex decision-making structures. It helps in handling multiple levels of conditions, where each condition is checked in a hierarchy.

Example:
age = 25
has_ID = True

if age >= 18:
    if has_ID:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You need an ID to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
