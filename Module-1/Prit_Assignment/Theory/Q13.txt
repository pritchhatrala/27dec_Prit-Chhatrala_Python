13. Introduction to for and while loops.

1. for Loop
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in that sequence. It is useful when you know beforehand how many times you want to repeat an action.
Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

2. while Loop
The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is True. It is useful when you don't know how many times you need to loop, but you have a condition that will eventually stop the loop.
Example:
counter = 0

while counter < 3:
    print("Counter is", counter)
    counter += 1
