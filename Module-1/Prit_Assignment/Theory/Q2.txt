1. The Birth of Python (1980s):
In December 1989, Guido van Rossum began working on Python at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. Python was conceived as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was also developed at CWI but had limitations in handling exceptions and interfacing with the operating system.
Guido van Rossum aimed to create a language that was easy to read and write while being powerful enough for system programming and application development.
