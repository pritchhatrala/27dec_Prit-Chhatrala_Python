24. Understanding how to access and manipulate strings.

n Python, strings are sequences of characters that can be accessed and manipulated using various methods. You can access individual characters using indexing (text[0] for the first character) and retrieve substrings using slicing (text[1:4] for characters from index 1 to 3). Strings support concatenation ("Hello" + " World" results in "Hello World") and repetition ("Hi" * 3 produces "HiHiHi"). Common string methods include upper() (converts to uppercase), lower() (converts to lowercase), strip() (removes whitespace), replace("old", "new") (replaces a substring), and split("delimiter") (splits into a list). Strings are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed directly, but new modified strings can be created. For example, text = "Python"; text = text.replace("P", "J") results in "Jython". Using formatted strings (f"Hello {name}") makes it easy to insert variables into text. These techniques help efficiently access and manipulate strings in Python.
