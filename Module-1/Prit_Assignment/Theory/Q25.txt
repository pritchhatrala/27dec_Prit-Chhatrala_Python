25. Basic operations: concatenation, repetition, string methods (upper(), lower(), etc.).
In Python, strings support various basic operations such as concatenation, repetition, and built-in methods. Concatenation is done using the + operator, e.g., "Hello" + " World" results in "Hello World". Repetition uses the * operator, e.g., "Hi" * 3 produces "HiHiHi". Python provides useful string methods, such as upper() to convert a string to uppercase ("hello".upper() → "HELLO"), lower() to convert it to lowercase ("HELLO".lower() → "hello"), strip() to remove leading and trailing spaces (" Hello ".strip() → "Hello"), replace(old, new) to replace substrings ("apple".replace("a", "o") → "opple"), and split(delimiter) to divide a string into a list ("a,b,c".split(",") → ['a', 'b', 'c']). These operations make string manipulation efficient and versatile in Python.
