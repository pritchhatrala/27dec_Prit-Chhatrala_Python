27. How functional programming works in Python.
Functional programming in Python is based on treating functions as first-class citizens, meaning functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. Key concepts include pure functions, which produce the same output for the same input without side effects, and higher-order functions, which take other functions as arguments or return them. Python provides built-in functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() to apply functions to iterables. Lambda functions (lambda x: x * 2) allow writing concise anonymous functions. Python also supports recursion, where functions call themselves, and immutability, which avoids modifying data directly. Although Python is not a purely functional language, it supports functional programming paradigms alongside object-oriented and procedural programming.
