7. Indentation, comments, and naming conventions in Python.

1-->Indentation: Python uses indentation (4 spaces per level) to define code blocks, instead of braces {} like other languages. Proper indentation is essential, as incorrect spacing will cause errors. 
Example:
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")  # Indented with 4 spaces

2-->Comments: Comments improve code readability and are ignored by the Python interpreter. Use # for single-line comments and triple quotes (""") for multi-line docstrings. 
Example:
# This is a single-line comment
"""
This is a multi-line comment or docstring.
It is often used for function documentation.
"""

3-->Naming Conventions: Follow PEP 8 guidelines for clear and consistent naming. Use snake_case for variables and functions, PascalCase for class names, and UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE for constants. 
Example:
user_name = "Alice"       # Variable (snake_case)
class UserProfile:        # Class (PascalCase)
MAX_LIMIT = 100          # Constant (UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE)
