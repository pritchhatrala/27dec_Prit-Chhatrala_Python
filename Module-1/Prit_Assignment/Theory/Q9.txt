9. Python variables and memory allocation. 

1. Python Variables
A variable in Python is a name that refers to a memory location where data is stored. Unlike statically typed languages, Python variables do not require explicit type declarations.

example:
x = 10      # Integer variable
y = 3.14    # Float variable
name = "Alice"  # String variable

2. Memory Allocation in Python
When you assign a value to a variable, Python allocates memory dynamically:

Small integers (-5 to 256) are stored in a shared pool to optimize performance.
Larger objects (strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.) are stored in heap memory.
Variables are references to memory locations rather than the actual values.

example:
a = 100
b = 100
print(a is b)  # Output: True (same memory reference for small integers)

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
print(x is y)  # Output: False (different memory locations)
